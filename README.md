## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm beginning to improve my flexbox understanding. I want to begin using a flex-first approach to improve my projects.

### Continued development

I'm still having trouble with some basic things like centering, and also standardizing my code. I hope that working with flex will improve this process.
